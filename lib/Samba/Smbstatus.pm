=head1 VERSION

Version 0.00_01

our $VERSION = '0.00_01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides information about current connections to the local Samba server.

    use Samba::Smbstatus;

    my $smbstats = Samba::Smbstatus->new;
    my $services = $smbstats->services;
    my $users = $smbstats->users;
    my $locks = $smbstats->locks;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module reads data from the local Samba server and returns information
about the current users, connections, and resources those users are using.

This information is currently gathered from 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Create the Samba::Smbstatus object.  Can be called with parameters to
configure the object.

Configuration parameters are:

=over 4

=item smbstatus_binary

Provide a path to the smbstatus binary to use to query the status of the
running server.  Defaults to searching the path for an smbstatus, which some
may consider insecure.

=cut

=head2 smbstatus_binary()

Fetch the name of the smbstatus binary used to query the running Samba
server.  Returns the default value, or the value set at init time.

=head2 services()

Returns information about what services are in use by what users.

Returns an array reference of hash references, each of which should have
the following keys:

=over 4

=item service

Name of the service being described by this entry.  Usually a share name,
but can also be printers, named pipes, or other Samba objects.

=item pid

Process ID of the process serving the data.  A client will be connected to
the socket this process has open.

=item machine

Name of the machine or service connected to this resource. Usually a host
name, but sometimes a synthetic client name.

=item connected

Time the client connected to this service.

=back

=cut

sub services {
    my $self = shift;

}

=head2 users()

Returns information about what users are connected to the server.

Returns an array reference of hash references, each of which should have
the following keys:

=over 4

=item pid

Process ID of the process serving the data.  A client will be connected to
the socket this process has open.

=item username

Name of the account used by this connection.

Returns information about what files are locked by the clients on this
Samba server..

Returns an array reference of hash references, each of which should have
the following keys:

=over 4

=item pid

Process ID of the process serving the data.  A client will be connected to
the socket this process has open.

=item uid

User ID used by this connection.  (Not a user name - names can be correlated
by pid from the users data.)

=item deny_mode

Read/write lock requested by this client.  Symbolic names from Samba.  Common
values are:

=over 4

=item DENY_NONE

=item DENY_ALL

=item DENY_READ

=item DENY_WRITE

what those mean.

=back

=item access

Numeric access code requested for this item.  Displayed as a hexidecimal value.

=item readwrite

Symbolic value describing how this file is being used by the client.  Values
are from Samba.  Known values are:

=item RDONLY

=item RDWR

=back

=item oplock

Symbolic values from Samba representing the operational locking mode for
this file.

Known values are:

=over 4

=item NONE

=item EXCLUSIVE+BATCH

=back

=item share

Name of the shared path opened by the client.  This is the path on the
local system.

=item name

Name of the item being used by the system.  It represents a file or directory
on the local sysetm in the share location.

=item time

Time the lock was made by this client.
